nstall Texture Replacer if you haven't already.

1. Download the .zip file and extract it into your KSP directory.

2. The head textures should all be under [KSP directory]/GameData/TextureReplacer/Heads

3. The .cfg file in each pack (i.e. GGDL_Default.cfg for the basic pack) should go under GameData/TextureReplacer, alongside @Default.cfg (if these don't work or are not installed correctly, then Texture Replacer will assume all the heads are for male kerbals, and your kerbals will all look like they just had their makeup done pin-the-tail-on-the-donkey-style.)

All packs should be co-installable, but filename collisions may happen accidentally. If you get it asking you to overwrite something when extracting a pack, let me know.
