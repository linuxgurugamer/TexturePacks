Installation

Copy/move `GameData/` from this package to your KSP directory.

`Source/kerbalHead.xcf` is the source image used to assemble the textures and
should be used to make modifications. I couldn't export a PSD from Gimp without
destroying layers, so the image is in Gimp's XCF format.

The original Sylith's PSD image can be found at:

This pack can be modified and distributed under the terms of CC BY 4.0 licence.
The original author is Sylith, with a few modifications added by shaw and IOI-655362.

shaw: The original textures have been extended with some more hair colour variations,
removed beards etc.) and have some other tweaks (removed eye shadows, fixed some
textures to match better at the back of a head, greener skin ...).

IOI-655362: The modified textures have been further modified to add more hair color
variation and facial features.  Feminine and masculine facial features have been 
accentuated to portray gender without relying too heavily on make-up and hairstyle.
Female kerbals' lipstick has been excluded.  Hairstyles are sometimes interchanged.
Eye lashes reduced.  Variation in skin tones.  Male kerbals have beard shadow 
(which can occur even on cleanly shaven faces, believe it or not).  In general, 
male/female differences made more subtle.
Thanks to shaw and Sylith for starting these great Kerbal faces!
